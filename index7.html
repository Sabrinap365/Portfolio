<h3>why mexico</h3>
<p style="background-color:#7cc5a9">Indulge in an all-inclusive resort and be pampered by the pool or explore the jungle of the Riviera Maya. No matter the season, a vacation to Mexico is just as magical in the summer as it is in the winter.</p>

<h2> Turks and Caicos </h2>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p style="background-color:#7cc5a9">Turks and Caicos is a small British Overseas Territory located between the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic. More than 40 islands and cays make up this Atlantic Ocean archipelago, where world-class beaches are the norm. English is the official language, and the U.S. dollar is the currency.

Unbelievable turquoise waters colored a shade that's truly unique to Turks and Caicos await visitors of this relatively undiscovered Caribbean beach destination. Experience it yourself. </p>
<h3> Why do I want to go</h3>
<p  style="background-color:#7cc5a9"> Went with my father and older sister a while ago, had an amazing time. The beaches were crystal clear. Overall an amazing vacation I would love to experience again</p>

	<h2> Hawaii</h2>
	<h3>why?</h3>
	<p  style="background-color:#7cc5a9"> You can travel through all but four of the world's different climate zones here, ranging from Wet Tropical to Polar Tundra, a result of the shielding effect and elevations of the massive volcanoes Maunakea and Maunaloa. From the many geological features at Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park to the snow-capped heights of Maunakea; from the lush valleys of the Hilo and Hāmākua Coasts to the jet-black sands of Punaluʻu Beach, the island of Hawaiʻi is an unrivaled expression of the power of nature. </p>
	<h2> Why do I want to go?</h2>
	<p  style="background-color:#7cc5a9">I want to go because of the diversity of nature, and all of the oppurtunities to explore and learn.</p>
