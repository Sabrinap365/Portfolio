                    <p>Dirt is the second studio album by American rock band Alice in Chains, released on September 29, 1992 by Columbia Records. It was the band's last album recorded with all four original members, as bassist Mike Starr was fired in January 1993 during the tour to support the album.[11] The majority of the songs were written by guitarist Jerry Cantrell, but for the first time, vocalist Layne Staley wrote two songs by himself ("Hate to Feel" and "Angry Chair"), both also featuring Staley on guitar. The track "Iron Gland" features Tom Araya from Slayer on vocals. The album's lyrics explore depression, pain, anger, anti-social behavior, relationships, drug (primarily heroin) addiction, war, death, and other emotionally charged topics.<p>
